# This project aims to enhance security measures by effectively identifying and alerting unauthorized individuals attempting to access a specific location. The implementation involves integrating several components, including Node-RED (a flow-based programming tool used for IoT applications), an ESP32 Cam (a microcontroller with a built-in camera module), AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud for cloud computing), and HiveMQ (a message broker for MQTT communication).
